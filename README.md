# Grandma

### What is Grandma?
Grandma is a web application I made for people to create and store recipes. It's specifically for people who want to write down their own recipes; it's not for linking from other websites.

### Why is Grandma?
Can software developers be cooks too? I love cooking, and whenever I see a video or interesting dish idea, I try to jot it down so that I can come back to it and make it myself. So why not just save the link somewhere? Well, a few reasons:
1. Most recipe websites are so chock-full of ads and popups that it's a small miracle if you make it to the recipe card. Plus, you have to read the author's entire life story before you get there.
2. Part of my love for cooking is not following recipes. Of course, I'll learn which ingredients are more or less necessary, and the approximate cooking method, but from there I like to freestyle. You're never going to catch me measuring tablespoons of salt for my bolognese. So I like to adapt the recipes in my own way.
3. Writing a recipe in your own words means you'll probably remember it much better than reading it from a website.
